"""
Test prompt collections for alignment testing.

These prompts are designed to test whether safety alignment is present in
the model weights or only in the prompt formatting. Prompts are organized
by category to analyze bypass patterns.

RESEARCH PURPOSE: These prompts test alignment mechanisms, not for generating
harmful content. They are based on published alignment research.
